# OpenX32 - A linux-based operating system for the Behringer X32

This repository contains software to load and start the Linux-Kernel on the Behringer X32. This audio-mixing-console uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX253 Microcontroller with an ARM926EJ-S core that supports booting Linux.

This means, this project is a temporary replacement of the mixer. After a power-cycle, the original firmware is in place again.
